# Group Math

The goal of the group math project is to create blocks of code that build on each other toward doing math on polynomials whose coefficients come from a finite set.  The development is hierarchical in that one block builds off of another.  A set called the incremental set forms the base or underlying set of an additive group that is built on top of it. A multiplicative group can be built out of the additive group.  A cyclic group can be formed and these groups can in turm be used as the coefficients for polynomials.  A cyclic group can be formed from polynomials which can result in a finite field.  Applications for this math based on groups include error-correcting codes, encryption and digital signatures.
